*Final Fantasy IX* (FFIX) focuses on a traditional JRPG ensemble with emotionally driven arcs (e.g., ViviÅfs existential crisis, ZidaneÅfs identity quest) and villains like Kuja (chaotic nihilism) and Garland (manipulative determinism). *Xenoblade Chronicles 2* (XC2) emphasizes modern themes like destiny and unity, with ShulkÅfs idealism, ReynÅfs loyalty, and antagonists like the High Entia (ideological rigidity vs. progress).
